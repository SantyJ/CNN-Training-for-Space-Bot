# CNN-Training-for-Space-Bot
Train the space bot using a Convolutional Neural Network model based on historical grid data and space rat positions / movements, to make better decisions in catching the space rat.

# Abstract
Building on the foundation of Project 2, In Project 3 we developed a neural network model to
predict the bot’s actions required to locate and capture the space rat in a dynamic grid-based simulation
of a ship. Using the probabilistic tracking framework from Project 2, the model predicts the number
of moves and sensor actions needed to achieve the goal. It was designed and tested for accuracy and
reliability, with performance evaluated through training and testing losses. Visualizations were used
to analyze how the model’s predictions align with or improve upon the bot’s actions. This project
demonstrates the potential of neural networks to enhance decision-making and strategies for tracking
and capturing moving targets in complex environments.
